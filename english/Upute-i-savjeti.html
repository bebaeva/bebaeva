                  <br>
                  <span style="font-weight: 700;">a) For the first 20 days, the baby does not bathe in the tub but wipes with gauze (tetra diaper) - ie wipes partially every day or every other day - do everything quickly and deftly (due to possible hypothermia of the baby).</span>
                  <br>
                  <br>1. Put a blanket under the baby; prepare a clean clothes and the rest before bathing<br>2. Prepare a little lukewarm water in a bowl.<br>3. Remove the upper part of the clothes from the baby, and the lower part of the body should remain well covered with the blanket.<br>4. Wet the top of the gauze, then first wash the eyes, forehead and then rest of the face and hands (which are always in the baby's mouth) and immediately wipe everything after.<br>5. Wash and wipe: the neck (raise the head - turning the baby on its side as needed) and the rest of the upper body, making sure to wash each joint (armpit, ...).<br>6. When the upper body is done, put on the baby's mole and body.<br>7. Remove clothing from the lower body including diapers.<br>8. Soak a gauze in water, wash and wipe all the folds, legs and between the joints and the rest of the lower body.<br>9. Do not put cream on the buttocks, only if the buttocks are red.<br>10. Then follows the navel care and the completion of the baby's swaddling.<br>
                  <br>
                  <span style="font-weight: 700;">b) The baby's first bath is on the 20th day from the day of birth (it is also valid every day after the first bath). </span><br>
                  <br>1. Prepare everything, clothes, diapers, blankets, ... shampoo, towel, ear sticks (to wipe the ears a little after bathing)
                  <br>2. Fill a full bath of water, measure the temperature of the water with the elbow, (when it is comfortable on the elbow then the temperature for bathing the baby), put a shampoo plug in the tub.<br>3. After the above preparations, only then remove the baby's robe.<br>4. Slowly transfer the baby and place it in the tub and wash it first from the front. (MAKE SURE YOU ALWAYS HOLD THE BABY'S HEAD)<br>5. Turn the baby (from hand to hand - watch the head, make sure the nose does not touch the water), and wash the baby behind.<br>6. Transfer the baby in the same position to a blanket (towel), wipe it and put it on (navel and bandage).<br>7. Do not apply any powder on the baby's body as it closes the pores and interferes with the skin's breathing, and can also cause allergies.<br>

                <ul class="u-custom-list u-text u-text-3">If the baby is not in the right position, she will not suck properly and the mother will have sore and injured nipples. For successful feeding, the infant must grasp the breast well with his mouth wide open. When we bring the baby to the breast, we must try to reach the lower jaw as much as possible under the nipple. The child instinctively opens his mouth when his lips touch his mother's nipple.<br>
                  <br>A large bite affects the breast - the baby's chin is next to the breast - the lower lip is upside down. This is what it looks like in the mouth of a child that affects the nipple and breast. If the position is correct, we can see how the jaw and sometimes even the ears move with each suction. Loud sucking or indented cheeks can mean that the baby needs to be pulled harder on the chest. The baby needs breastfeeding, not nipple sucking.<br>
                  <br>
                  <span style="font-weight: 700;">BREAST-FEEDING</span>
                  <br>
                  <br>1. Milk development takes 20 days. Then do not eat cellulose (eg lettuce, cucumber. Cauliflower, etc.)<br>2. Drink 3-5 liters of fluid a day.<br>3. The breastfeeding mother's diet is only 10% more than the usual feeding. Do not force milk if the breastfeeding mother has not learned to drink milk (replace it with cheese, butter, yoghurt, etc.)<br>4. A breastfeeding mother stool should be had at least every other day. If there are isn't take local glycerin suppositories for adults. (Do not take anything by mouth, no stool medications, no compotes or things the like.)<br>5. Take a shower every day with lukewarm water (never lie in the bath for 6 weeks after giving birth) and always have someone in the household close to the breastfeeding mother while taking a shower. 6. Episiotomy care only clean and dry, no teas or sprays.<br>7. When breastfeeding, the relaxing position of the breastfeeding mother is important.<br>8. While breastfeeding she is not allowed to receive any visits and talk. Only the breastfeeding mother must be alone with her baby, while the breastfeeding mother must belong to the baby psychophysically and emotionally completely. Only the father of the child can be with her during breastfeeding.<br>9. Before breastfeeding, you should prepare one glass of a drink, drink it after breastfeeding (you can also eat something) and stay to rest for half an hour with your legs slightly raised.<br>10. If she feels that he has cramps in his legs, increase the dose of calcium intake.<br>11. During milk production, there is heavy and frequent intermittent sweating in breastfeeding mothers<br>12. While breastfeeding, mild vaginal bleeding is common.<br>13. It is important to know the length of breastfeeding.<br>14. Fluid control in newborns (fontanelles, diapers)<br>15. Bloody vomiting of the newborn<br>16. Vomiting of a newborn<br>17. Vomiting in jets on the nose and mouth in newborns<br>18. A stuffy nose in a newborn<br>19. Drinks, how they are prepared and when they are given to a newborn<br>20. Fatty milk in the mother prolongs jaundice in the newborn.<br>21. Newborn weight (physiological weight loss-10%)<br>22. The smell and warmth of the mother's body attracts the newborn<br>23. Breastfeeding breasts are warm and richly streaked with blood vessels<br>24. The most important is the first encounter of a newborn nipple milk that serves as the first record in the head for long successful breastfeeding<br>25. Medications given during childbirth lull the newborn to sleep and interfere with the sucking reflex as well as change the composition of the milk until it is excreted from the breastfeeding mother's body (caesarean section)<br>26. Antibiotics reduce the amount and change the taste of breast milk to the detriment of the newborn<br>27. Signs of hunger in a newborn are: green stools, urine is not colorless, cries a lot, often sucks the breast, drinks a lot of fluids and does not have a full stomach<br>28. Mastitis or inflammation of the breast (how to prevent it)<br>29. Ragade or injured nipples (how to prevent it)<br>30. Sucking reflex in newborns (winds, wheezing, hiccups and sneezing)<br>
                  <br>
                  <span style="font-weight: 700;">IMPORTANT!</span>
                  <br>
                  <br>Breastfeeding a newborn born normally without any medication to the mother during delivery<br>1. After childbirth immediately give the mother to breastfeed<br>2. No artificial supplementation<br>3. The first record in a newborn’s head must be the nipple and the taste of breast milk<br>4. The length of breastfeeding is important<br>5. Newborn sucking reflex - struggle for survival<br>6. Release of air taken by suction<br>

                  <br>Muscles are made up of striped muscles that work by our will and smooth muscles that do not work by our will. All our muscles must be supplied with oxygen in order to work normally. If they are not supplied with oxygen, painful spasms occur. By taking in oxygen, we also take in positive spiritual energy, which stimulates the work of the muscles. Under the smooth muscles, there is also the uterus, which needs to be filled with special breathing and oxygen and positive energy during the entire birth. Through 5 seconds of inhalation. enough oxygen is introduced into the uterus for its complete and responsible work during childbirth.<br>
                  <br>Through a 5 second break we give space for that oxygen to be absorbed or resorbed into the uterus, placenta and baby.<br>In 7 seconds we allow carbon monoxide to be expelled from the whole lungs. We must stop the exhalation with our lips so that all the air does not come out suddenly.<br>Through a 5 second break we give time to the bronchi in the lungs to expand to receive new oxygen.<br>
                  <br>In this way, we supply the uterus with oxygen and prevent its painful contractions, which would occur due to lack of oxygen. By breathing properly during childbirth, there are no cramps, the uterus works calmly and labor is painless.<br>
                  <br>During labor in the first postpartum period, only the chest should be breathed 5 + 5 + 7 + 5. We do not strain the diaphragm with such breathing, because if the diaphragm is strained, the uterus is pressed and its smooth work is disturbed.<br>
                  <br>Efforts are mostly made instinctively. It is necessary to cooperate with the midwife so that she leads the second childbirth period, ie the very end of childbirth.<br>Concentration is especially important then because the child is born outside with tension and pressure. Then he takes a deep breath, exhales briefly 2 times quickly and with the retained rest of the air he presses as if he had a hard stool. .the bottom of the pelvis to make the baby come out softer. In this position, gynecological examinations in childbirth are easier. Do not inflate your mouth with air or strain your arms.<br>
                  <br>It is important that the whole body is as relaxed as possible, while all the strength and thought of the mother is directed towards the expulsion of the child.<br>
                  <br>Relaxation is important in the effort, which then lasts 2-3 minutes. The mother must be concentrated and relax during the voltage break, gather strength to finish the birth quickly and easily, because that is the end of the birth itself.<br>
                  <br>
                  <span style="font-weight: 700;">EXERCISES FOR BIRTH AND AFTER BIRTH (10 times)</span>
                  <br>
                  <br>a) "CAT" position On the knees and arms, so the spine bends. This exercise is good for the elasticity of the spine for pregnancy, childbirth and after childbirth.<br>b) Same position, raise left arm, then right arm, then raise left leg, then right leg<br>c) lying position - put your hands with intertwined fingers together behind the neck, legs bent at the knees and slightly raising the head- this is for the strength of the abdominal muscles<br>d) arms and legs in the same position and gently lifting the buttocks for easier delivery<br>e) sit comfortably, spread your legs and press your knees that give resistance, it is physical preparation for childbirth<br>f) in this position join hands and squeeze, exercise the pectoral muscles and breasts and prepare them for childbirth<br>

                <ul class="u-custom-list u-text u-text-5">All health professionals know that it is important to warn the mother to breathe through her nose during childbirth. The whole course of childbirth must be breathed through the nose and exhaled through the mouth. She must be focused on that important action. Breathing through the nose enables the introduction of NITROGEN OXIDE during childbirth - that wonderful gas that allows the channels in the lungs and arteries to expand so that the blood can easily and freely flow through the body.<br>
                  <br>The discovery of this important gas - nitric oxide - deserved the Nobel Prize. In fact, it has been discovered that this gas, nitric oxide, is a neurotransmitter in nerve cells. It plays a fundamental role in the health of the body.<br>
                  <br>Despite its short life, nitric oxide affects many organs. In the brain, it acts as a neurotransmitter and quickly transmits messages. Like the chemicals in the brain, serotonin and dopamine, promote a sense of serenity and serenity, nitric oxide has a calming effect.<br>
                  <br>
                  <span style="font-weight: 700;">WHY?</span>
                  <br>
                  <br>This gas in our cells triggers a chain reaction that relaxes and dilates blood vessels and fills the uterine muscle with enough blood to work normally. Lack of nitric oxide can explain harmful, painful cramps in the uterine muscle that deplete the mother and impede the normal, painless course of labor.<br>
                  <br>
                  <span style="font-weight: 700;">How to get that gas?</span>
                  <br>
                  <br>The highest levels of nitric oxide are found in the back of the nasal cavity and that is why breathing through the nose and meditation are extremely important. The flow of air that is created as you breathe through your nose allows rich reserves of nitric oxide to enter your system. Nitric oxide then promotes the dilation of the arteries, and the blood continues to flow easily as if rushing down an empty country road rather than congested city streets.<br>
